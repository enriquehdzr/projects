I share with you a few codes that I could find in my computer. Most of the codes that i have developed are property of my University
until they release my Thesis to be freely shared. I tried to write a little description on every code of what it is used for.
Also, I'am still trying to get a few more codes that I have on the school computer but it is not allowed to get access remotely so i hope
to get them ASAP.
This may not be as awesome as you would have expected but feel yourself confident on my great quicklearning and selflearning sense.

At my Thesis project i needed to use linear regression and also tree decision for being able to predict future behaivor not only for molecules but also for the mathematical model eficiency.

I share with you a few codes that I could find in my computer. Most of the codes that i have developed are property of my University
until they release my Thesis to be freely shared. I tried to write a little description on every code of what it is used for.
Also, I'am still trying to get a few more codes that I have on the school computer but it is not allowed to get access remotely so i hope
to get them ASAP.
